# 99 Bottles

## Learning notes from Sandi Metz's 99 bottle book

Thing I have learned so far: 

Value/Cost

Value: Ask domain questions 
Cost:  Ask the following three questions: 
- How difficult was this to write?   
- How hard is it to understand?
- How expensive will it be to change? (Which also take how hard to understand in consideration)

DRY has cost.  I think we should understand why we doing things (value/cost), instand of just follow a convention. 

When writing code or code review in the early stage, no need to chase the most abstract or optimazed code (while I consider "beautiful" or "smart" which could be totally not necessory), as long as it has a clean interface and readable, it should be benefit current progess and future changeability 
`The goal is to use green to maximize your understanding of the problem and to unearth all available information before committing to abstractions.`
